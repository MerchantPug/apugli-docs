### Example
```json
"entity_action": {
    "type": "apugli:explode",
    "radius": 3.0,
    "behavior": "none",
    "use_charged": true,
    "spawn_effect_cloud": false,
    "damage_source": {
        "name": "overheat",
        "bypasses_armor": "true",
        "fire": "true",
        "unblockable": "true"
    },
    "amount": 9999.0
}
```
This action creates a non destructive explosion with a radius of 3.0F. If TooManyOrigins or CursedOrigins has been initialized it will consume the charged ability from either mod upon use to make a larger blast, this will also instakill the entity with armor bypassing, unblockable fire damage named overheat.

Draconic Breath | `toomanyorigins:dragon_breath` | You're able to conjure a ball of armour-piercing draconic flame that leaves a lingering cloud wherever it lands. It can also act as fuel for furnaces. | Your active power (default: G) has 2 uses. While not looking at a block in the tag `toomanyorigins:lightable` you are able to breathe out a small fireball with similar functionality to the ender dragon's, once it lands it creates an AoE that deals 3 hearts of unblockable, armor piercing damage when they are in the AoE's hurtbox. The other power activates when you're looking at any block in `toomanyorigins:lightable` and it allows you to light up a furnace for 2600 fuel ticks, light up unlit campfires and to fill a brewing stand with fuel. Both of these abilities have separate 4 second long cooldowns.

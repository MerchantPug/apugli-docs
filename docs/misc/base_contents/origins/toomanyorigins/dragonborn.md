Draconic Breath | `toomanyorigins:draconic_breath` | You are able to breathe out a ball of elemental breath, the element of your breath can be changed by using specific items. | Your active power (default: G) allows you to breathe out a fireball that can be one of three different types that upon landing, will turn into an area of effect cloud that do different things. You are able to swap between these types by using an item in your main or offhand.

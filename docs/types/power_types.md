# Power Types

"Powers are what grants functionality to your origins! Each power has a type, specified with a `type` field in the JSON. Which type a power is defines which other fields it requires and supports.

Unless stated otherwise, each power type supports a `condition` field with an [entity condition](https://origins.readthedocs.io/en/latest/entity_conditions/). See [Power JSON](https://origins.readthedocs.io/en/latest/power_json/) for more details." - Origins Documentation

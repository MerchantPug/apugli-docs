![Hiss-kin (Rework)](../../../../images/tmoHissKinBannerRework.png)

Name | ID | Description (In-Game) | Description (Detailed)
-----|----|-----------------------|------------------------
Buildup | `toomanyorigins:buildup` | You are able to rocket jump away from any object you are looking at, you can use this whilst on cooldown, but it will harm you. | Your active power (default: G) lets you launch yourself in the opposite direction you're facing while summoning an explosion if your crosshair is on a block or an entity. You are able to use this whilst on cooldown (15 ticks) but you will be damaged if you do.
Aerial Stability | `toomanyorigins:aerial_stability` | Your downward velocity is slightly lowered. | Your Y velocity/motion is reduced by 35% and is capped at -1.1 provided you aren't in a liquid, fall flying or a passenger.
Stubby Legs | `toomanyorigins:stubby_legs` | Your shorter legs make you move slower on foot. | Your movement speed on the ground is reduced by 25%.
Conductive | `toomanyorigins:conductive` | When struck by lightning, you become charged. | Getting struck by lightning inflicts you with the [Charged](../../../effects/charged.md) status effect for 8 minutes, whilst under this effect, your rocket jump power is boosted and your received fall damage is reduced by 40%.
*hidden* | `toomanyorigins:ailurophobia` | *none.* | Your player model shakes whilst near cats, ocelots or a player with the [Feline](https://origins.readthedocs.io/en/latest/misc/base_contents/origins/feline/) origin.
*hidden* | `toomanyorigins:redirect_lightning_chance` | *none.* | You have a 2.5% chance to redirect the position of lightning that spawns in the world to your current position.
